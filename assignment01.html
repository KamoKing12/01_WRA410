<ul>
    <li>The album I'm currently listening to is Bewitched by Laufey</li>
    <li>I just finished reading Babel by R. F. Kuang</li>
    <li>My zodiac sign is Leo</li> 
</ul>

<p>I'm a bit familiar with HTML, CSS, and Javascript from previous classes but I don't have much experience with them beyond that. I started to learn some Bootstrap for my on-campus job.</p>

<p>I'd like to learn more about CSS, Javascript, and Bootstrap to understand how to develop any designs I'd make in Figma </p>
